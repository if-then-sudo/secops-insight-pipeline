# 🛡️ SecOps Insight Pipeline

**A Project Management Case Study in Data Engineering for Cybersecurity**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A complete ETL pipeline that analyzes security incidents and generates interactive dashboards. Built to demonstrate the intersection of:
- Technical skills (Python, SQL, data visualization)
- Project Management (planning, documentation, methodology)
- Business Intelligence (KPIs, dashboards, storytelling)
- Cybersecurity domain knowledge

## 📊 The Dashboard

Analyzes 100 security incidents showing:
- Total incidents and severity breakdown
- Cost impact ($5M+)
- Response time metrics
- Trends over 30 days
- Interactive visualizations

  ## 📸 Dashboard Preview
